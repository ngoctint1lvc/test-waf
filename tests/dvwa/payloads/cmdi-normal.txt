You should change your /etc/passwd file
/bin/bash is your bash binary file
Here is an example: ls -l /home/ryan
cd — Use the "cd" command to go to a directory.
mkdir & rmdir — Use the mkdir command when you need to create a folder or a directory
then you can type "mkdir DIY"
Use "rm -r" to delete just the directory. 
For example, “touch new.txt”.
man & --help — To know more about a command and how to use it
cp — Use the cp command to copy files through the command line
For example, if we want to rename the file “text” to “new”, we can use “mv text new”
when you type in “locate -i hello”
For example, if you want to create a new text file or add to an already made text file, you just need to type in, “echo hello, my name is alok >> new.txt”.
For example, if you want to edit a file like viz. alsa-base.conf
Press 'ctrl + d' to return to command prompt.
The syntax to combine 2 files is cat file1 file2 > newfilename
Suppose we want to move the file "sample2" to location /home/guru99/Documents. Executing the command
will create a directory 'Music' under '/tmp' directory
cat filename | less 
For this the syntax would be: cat sample | grep -E p\{2}
We can use command like cat sample|grep "a\+t"
The syntax for brace expansion is either a sequence or a comma separated list of items inside curly braces "{}". The starting and ending items in a sequence are separated by two periods "..".
